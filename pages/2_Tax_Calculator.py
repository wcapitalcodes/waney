The effective tax rate is the average rate at which an individual or a corporation is taxed on their taxable income. It is calculated by dividing the total tax paid by the total taxable income. This rate provides a more accurate representation of the actual tax burden compared to marginal tax rates, which only apply to the last dollar of income.

#### Example
If an individual has a total taxable income of RM 100,000 and they pay RM 15,000 in taxes, their effective tax rate would be:


$$ {Effective Tax Rate} = \\frac{15,000}{100,000} = 0.15 \\text{ or }15 \\text{ percent} $$

#### Normal Range of Effective Tax Rates

- **Low-Income Earners**: Typically 0% to 10%
- **Middle-Income Earners**: Typically 10% to 25%
- **High-Income Earners**: Typically 25% to 40%

For corporations:
- **Small Businesses**: Typically 10% to 20%
- **Large Corporations**: Typically 20% to 30%

Factors influencing effective tax rates include tax deductions and credits, tax-advantaged accounts, income composition, and geographic location.
