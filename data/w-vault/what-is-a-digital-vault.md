# What is a Digital Vault
A Digital Vault is an online security space, just like a safe deposit box but on the internet. It's like a virtual vault where you can securely store and protect important documents and files, similar to how you'd keep valuable items safe in a physical vault. It's designed to safeguard digital assets, like important files and documents, ensuring they stay protected and secure.
