# About Wahine Capital

Wahine Capital was founded by Rejina Rahim and Sherry Sheriff.
 
Rejina Rahim has 24 years of experience in Investment Mangement. She was the Ex-MD of Nomura Asset Management, Malaysia. Sherry Sheriff has a vast experience as Women's rights subject matter expert & she was the Ex Regulator with Securities Commission Malaysia. 

Wahine Capital was born during the COVID lockdown with a vision to empower women through financial knowledge and collaborative platforms. We aim to revolutionize women's role in the economy, fostering balance and sustainability.

At Wahine Capital, we envisage a future where women flourish with confidence, skills, and financial acumen. Despite the surge in women's consumerism, their representation and ownership in the economy still lag. Our aspiration is to drive a harmonious, sustainable contribution of women to society and the economy.
